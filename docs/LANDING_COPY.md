## 7. Use Cases

**Section label:** USE CASES
**Section headline:** Real-world automations that save hours every week

---

**Lead Scoring Without the Spreadsheet**
Assign point values to tags, engagement signals, and custom field values. Score It calculates a composite lead score and updates it on the contact record automatically -- no manual tracking needed.

**Smart Data Formatting**
Contacts enter your CRM with messy data -- inconsistent capitalization, bad phone numbers, missing fields. Format It, Name Parse It, and Clear It clean up records the moment they arrive, so your team always works with accurate data.

**Campaign A/B Testing**
Split It randomly assigns contacts to test groups based on percentages you define. Run A/B tests on email sequences, landing pages, or follow-up timing without writing any code or building complex CRM logic.

**Cross-Platform Data Sync**
Google Sheet It pushes contact data to a Google Sheet in real-time as contacts move through your CRM workflows. Keep your sales team, fulfillment team, or external partners updated without manual exports.

**Time-Zone Aware Automations**
When Is It and Timezone Triggers adjust follow-up timing based on each contact's local time zone. Send emails and trigger sequences at the right time, even when your contacts are spread across the globe.

**Automated Lifecycle Notifications**
Notify Me sends Slack messages, emails, or SMS alerts when contacts hit key milestones -- new purchases, failed payments, appointment no-shows, or high lead scores. Stay on top of what matters without monitoring your CRM constantly.

**Contact Merge and Deduplication**
Merge It combines duplicate contact records, preserving the most recent or most complete data. Found It searches for existing records before creating new ones, preventing duplicates from entering your CRM in the first place.

**Customer Lifetime Value Tracking**
The CLV helper calculates customer lifetime value based on purchase history and updates a custom field on the contact. Use it to segment high-value customers for VIP treatment or identify accounts at risk of churning.

## 10. FAQ

**Section label:** FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
**Section headline:** Common questions, clear answers

---

**What CRM platforms does MyFusion Helper work with?**
MyFusion Helper supports Keap (Infusionsoft), GoHighLevel, ActiveCampaign, Ontraport, and HubSpot. Each platform connects through OAuth or API key authentication. The same 62 helpers work across all supported CRMs through a unified connector layer, so your automations transfer if you ever switch platforms.

**Do I need to know how to code?**
No. Every helper is configured through a visual interface -- you pick your settings, rules, and fields from dropdowns and forms. The system generates a webhook URL that you paste into your CRM automation. If your CRM supports automations or campaigns, you can use MyFusion Helper.

**How do helpers get triggered?**
Each helper generates a unique webhook URL. You place that URL inside a CRM automation, campaign, or workflow. When the CRM fires that automation step, it sends a POST request to the webhook URL, which triggers the helper. The helper executes, performs the action on your CRM, and logs the result. The whole process happens in real-time.

**Is my CRM data secure?**
Yes. OAuth tokens and API keys are encrypted at rest. Data is transmitted over HTTPS. We do not store your CRM contact data -- helpers read and write directly to your CRM via API. Execution logs contain only metadata (contact ID, status, duration), not personal information. The platform runs on AWS with enterprise-grade infrastructure.

**Can I use MyFusion Helper with multiple CRM accounts?**
Yes. You can connect multiple CRM accounts -- even from different platforms -- to a single MyFusion Helper account. The Grow plan includes 3 connections and the Deliver plan includes unlimited connections. This is ideal for agencies managing multiple client accounts.

**What happens when my trial ends?**
After your 14-day trial, you can choose a plan that fits your needs. If you do not select a plan, your helpers will be paused but your configuration will be preserved. You can reactivate at any time by subscribing to a plan -- nothing is deleted.

**How is MyFusion Helper different from Zapier or Make?**
Zapier and Make are general-purpose integration platforms. MyFusion Helper is purpose-built for CRM automation. Our 62 helpers are designed specifically for CRM operations -- tagging, scoring, formatting, date calculations, contact merging, and more. They understand CRM data structures natively, run faster (sub-second execution), cost less, and require no multi-step flow building. You configure a helper once and trigger it with a single webhook.

**Can I cancel or change my plan at any time?**
Yes. You can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel your subscription at any time from the Settings page. Upgrades take effect immediately with prorated billing. Downgrades take effect at the start of your next billing cycle. Cancellation stops billing at the end of the current period -- no long-term contracts, no cancellation fees.

**Do you offer a free plan?**
We offer a 14-day free trial on all plans so you can test the full platform before committing. After the trial, paid plans start at $39 per month. We are evaluating a limited free tier for the future.

**What kind of support do you offer?**
All plans include email support. The Grow plan adds priority support with faster response times. The Deliver plan includes phone support for direct, immediate help. We also provide documentation, in-app AI chat assistance, and a knowledge base with setup guides for each CRM platform.
