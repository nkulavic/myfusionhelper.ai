## 8. FAQ Section

**Section label:** FAQ
**Section headline:** Frequently asked questions

### How does MyFusion Helper connect to my CRM?
We use official OAuth2 or API key connections depending on your platform. For Keap, GoHighLevel, and HubSpot, you authorize through a secure OAuth flow. For ActiveCampaign and Ontraport, you provide your API key. We never store your CRM login credentials.

### Is my data secure?
Yes. All data is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256). Our infrastructure runs on AWS with SOC 2 compliant services. We follow the principle of least privilege -- helpers only access the specific CRM data they need.

### Can I use MyFusion Helper with multiple CRM platforms?
Absolutely. You can connect multiple CRM platforms simultaneously. The Grow plan supports up to 3 connections and the Deliver plan supports unlimited connections. This is ideal for agencies managing clients across different platforms.

### What happens when a helper fails?
Failed executions are logged with full error details. You can configure email or Slack notifications for failures. The AI insights system analyzes error patterns and suggests fixes. Transient failures (API timeouts, rate limits) are automatically retried.

### Do I need coding skills?
No. Every helper is configured through a visual interface with dropdowns, toggles, and form fields. For advanced users, we support custom webhook payloads and conditional logic, but these are all configured visually.

### How do webhooks work?
Each helper gets a unique webhook URL. You add this URL as an HTTP POST action in your CRM automation or campaign. When the automation fires, it sends contact data to MyFusion Helper, which executes the configured helper. Full request and response logs are available.

### Can I cancel anytime?
Yes. All plans are month-to-month with no long-term commitments. You can cancel from your Settings page at any time. Annual plans are billed upfront but can be canceled with a prorated refund.

### What CRM platforms do you support?
We currently support Keap (Infusionsoft), GoHighLevel, ActiveCampaign, Ontraport, and HubSpot. We are actively adding new platform integrations based on user demand.

### Is there a free plan?
We offer a 14-day free trial on all plans with full access to features. No credit card is required to start your trial.

### How is MyFusion Helper different from Zapier or Make?
MyFusion Helper is purpose-built for CRM professionals. Unlike general automation platforms, every helper is designed specifically for CRM operations -- tagging, scoring, field manipulation, contact management. Plus, our AI layer provides insights, recommendations, and email composition that generic tools simply do not offer.
